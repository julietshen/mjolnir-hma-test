# Whether the bot should autojoin rooms it is invited to or not
autojoin: true

# If `autojoin` is true, this defines whether anyone can invite the bot (the

# should be set to true (only allow people in the management room to do invites)
# when using autojoin.
autojoinOnlyIfManager: false

# The room ID where people can use the bot. The bot has no access controls, so

syncOnStartup: true

# Set to false to prevent Mjolnir from checking its permissions on startup. This

# If true, Mjolnir won't actually ban users or apply server ACLs, but will

# bot might not be trusted fully, yet. Default false (do bans/ACLs).
noop: false

# Set to true to use /joined_members instead of /state to figure out who is
# in the room. Using /state is preferred because it means that users are
# banned when they are invited instead of just when they join, though if your
# server struggles with /state requests then set this to true.
fasterMembershipChecks: false

# A case-insensitive list of ban reasons to automatically redact a user's
