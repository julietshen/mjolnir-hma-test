# HMA Integration Plans: Real CSAM Detection via ThreatExchange

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the integration plan for connecting Mjolnir's HMA Plugin to real CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) detection services through Facebook's ThreatExchange HMA (Hasher-Matcher-Actioner) system, which provides seamless integration with NCMEC's Hash Sharing API.

**Current Status**: Mjolnir HMA Plugin is production-ready but connected to placeholder endpoints  
**Goal**: Enable real-time CSAM detection using authoritative hash databases  
**Solution**: Deploy Facebook ThreatExchange HMA as middleware service  
**Timeline**: Can be implemented immediately with proper credentials and deployment

## Background

### Problem Statement
Our Mjolnir HMA Plugin is fully functional but lacks connection to real CSAM detection services. While NCMEC provides the authoritative Hash Sharing API for CSAM detection, it uses XML-based queries rather than the real-time JSON API our plugin expects.

### Solution Discovery
Facebook's ThreatExchange HMA system provides the perfect bridge:
- **Built-in NCMEC Integration**: Native support for NCMEC Hash Sharing API
- **API Compatibility**: Provides exactly the REST API format our plugin expects  
- **Production Ready**: Used by major platforms for real CSAM detection
- **Open Source**: Available for self-deployment and customization

## Security and Privacy Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Hash-Only Transmission**: Only cryptographic hashes sent to external services
- **No Media Storage**: Original media not retained by HMA services
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logs for compliance and investigation
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access to HMA service and configurations

### Privacy Controls
```bash
# Configure privacy-conscious settings
!mjolnir protections config HMAPlugin logSuccessfulScans false  # Reduce logging
!mjolnir protections config HMAPlugin quarantineOnBlock true   # Auto-quarantine
```

### Compliance Requirements
- **Data Residency**: Consider hosting HMA service in appropriate jurisdiction
- **Retention Policies**: Configure log retention according to legal requirements
- **Access Auditing**: Monitor and log all administrative access
- **Incident Reporting**: Establish procedures for CSAM detection incidents

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

**Detection Metrics**:
- CSAM detection rate (blocks per total scans)
- False positive rate (manual review outcomes)
- Response time from hash generation to decision
- Hash database coverage and freshness

**Operational Metrics**:
- HMA service uptime and availability
- NCMEC API response times and error rates
- Plugin processing times and throughput
- Rate limiting effectiveness and queue depths

**Security Metrics**:
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Quarantine action success rates
- Incident response times
- Compliance audit results

### Monitoring Dashboard

```yaml
# Grafana dashboard configuration
dashboard:
  panels:
    - title: "CSAM Detection Rate"
      query: "rate(csam_blocks_total[5m])"
    
    - title: "HMA Service Response Time"
      query: "histogram_quantile(0.95, hma_request_duration_seconds)"
    
    - title: "NCMEC API Status"
      query: "up{service='ncmec-api'}"
    
    - title: "Error Rate"
      query: "rate(http_requests_total{status=~'5..'}[5m])"
```

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: HMA service becomes unavailable  
**Impact**: No CSAM detection during outage  
**Mitigation**: 
- Deploy redundant HMA instances
- Implement health checks and automatic failover
- Configure graceful degradation (fail-open behavior)

**Risk**: NCMEC API rate limiting  
**Impact**: Reduced detection capability  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement intelligent rate limiting in plugin
- Cache negative results to reduce API calls
- Request rate limit increases from NCMEC

**Risk**: False positive detections  
**Impact**: Legitimate content incorrectly blocked  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement confidence thresholds
- Manual review process for borderline cases
- Feedback loop to improve detection accuracy

### Operational Risks

**Risk**: Inadequate incident response  
**Impact**: Poor handling of CSAM detection events  
**Mitigation**:
- Develop comprehensive incident response procedures
- Train staff on CSAM handling protocols
- Establish clear escalation paths

**Risk**: Compliance violations  
**Impact**: Legal and regulatory consequences  
**Mitigation**:
- Regular compliance audits
- Legal review of procedures
- Staff training on applicable laws and regulations
