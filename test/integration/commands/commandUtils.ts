 * Returns a promise that resolves to an event that is reacting to the event produced by targetEventThunk.

 * This function assumes that the start() has already been called on the client.
 * @param targetRoom The room to listen for the reaction in.
 * @param reactionKey The reaction key to wait for.
 * @param targetEventThunk A function that produces an event ID when called. This event ID is then used to listen for a reaction.
